[12:24:00 AM] Vincent: 1. Finding and finalizing the datasets (2 datasets) – based on the criteria for Big Data Programming - Size of data, what kinds of analysis can be performed. 
2. Creating a list of Analysis which fall in the scope of Big Data Analytics 

(TOOLS & ALGORITHMS)
1. Deciding on whether - "Programming with Big Data in R" project (pbdR) can perform all the analytics required or not – Or should we switch for Python (Pandas & SciKit)
2. I am more confident with R – so I would like to check pbdR thoroughly and make sure we can perform all analytics with it. 
3. Deciding the scope of MapReduce Algorithms in the chosen datasets 
4. Gathering Java resources for MapReduce and other resources of Hadoop programming
5. Finalizing on what analysis to be done on which Tool – (R, Hadoop)

(SCRIPTING & DEBUGGING)
1. Writing the codes in the chosen tools for each of Analytics decided in the list, compiling and running them
2. Making sense of the results & debugging all the errors
3. Finalizing the script codes and final outputs 

(FINALIZING REPORTS & DRAFTING)
1. Creating output reports – graphing and finalizing the reports
2. Creating the Word Documentation – Draft 

Submitting all the work files, documentation and script codes to you.
